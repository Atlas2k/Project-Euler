# Project Euler

This is a little personal repo where I add solutions to some Project Euler problems. The purpose of this is to practice and demonstrate my problem solving skills and maybe help someone stuck on one of the problems.

[Here](https://projecteuler.net/) is a link to the Project Euler website.

That's it, have a good one bud.
